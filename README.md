I would like to build a storefront application for my sister's canvas art painting business. Right now, she has a website that is not the most user friendly. I would like to have the ability for customers to add the listed paintings into their cart to purchase. Ideally, I would implement debit/credit card payments as well as Apple Pay. I would also like to implement a tutorial part of the app. Customers who subscribe monthly will have access to art tutorials that my sister would upload into the app on a monthly basis. Finally, I would like to implement some sort of rewards or discount system.

## Notes

I did not know how to associate names with components of the UI such as labels or buttons at first. I researched IBOutlets and learned that this is what I needed to implement in order to make the text color of each of my labels change once the button was pressed.
